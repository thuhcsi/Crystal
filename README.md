# Crystal Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engine

C++ implementation of Crystal Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.

The Crystal TTS engine provides an implementation of a unified framework for multilingual TTS synthesis engine C Crystal.  The unified framework defines the common TTS modules for different languages and/or dialects.  The interfaces between consecutive modules conform to Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) specification for standardization, in-teroperability, multilinguality, and extensibility.
